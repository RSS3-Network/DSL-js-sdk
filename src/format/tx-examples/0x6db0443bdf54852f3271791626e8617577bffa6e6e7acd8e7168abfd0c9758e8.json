In 2015, Greyscale Investments became a subsidiary of [Digital Currency Group](https://iq.wiki/wiki/digital-currency-group), a venture capital company focusing on the digital currency market. The same year, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTCQX: GBTC) began trading over-the-counter on the OTCQX market, becoming the first publicly traded [bitcoin](https://iq.wiki/wiki/bitcoin) fund in the United States. [\\[18\\]](#cite-id-4xebjr8jpmi)  \n  \nIn January 2017, Grayscale sought to turn GBTC into an ETF (Exchanged-Traded Fund) but withdrew the application in October 2017 after the SEC indicated that it wasn’t yet comfortable with the bitcoin market [\\[4\\]](#cite-id-x1064i33gk). Grayscale launched two additional [cryptocurrency](https://iq.wiki/wiki/cryptocurrency) investment funds in 2017 which held [Ethereum Classic](https://iq.wiki/wiki/ethereum-classic) and Zcash.

[\\[6\\]](#cite-id-a6wgcw1l8e)[\\[19\\]](#cite-id-oq3r63v48g)  \n  \nIn 2021, Grayscale Investments added Grayscale [Solana](https://iq.wiki/wiki/solana) Trust to its portfolio, the 16th fund it manages. [\\[8\\]](#cite-id-dswgqo8cc7u)  \n  \n> “What's been interesting about Solana is that it gives users the ability to learn, experiment, and build. They generally have more budget to experiment on the protocol than some other more established blockchains like Ethereum, because of lower transaction fees.” - Grayscale CEO, Michael Sonnenshein mentioned.

The denial prompted Grayscale to sue SEC on the 29th of June, 2022. [\\[10\\]](#cite-id-f5q7k8rwh3p)[\\[12\\]](#cite-id-o071u7wfis)  \n  \n> “Grayscale supports and believes in the SEC’s mandate to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets and facilitate capital formation – and we are deeply disappointed by and vehemently disagree with the SEC's decision to continue to deny spot bitcoin ETFs from coming to the U.S. market.” - Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said in a statement. [\\[11\\]](#cite-id-dxomjpajdha)  \n  \nDuring the court proceedings held on March 7, 2023, the panel of appeals court judges questioned the U.S. SEC's logic in drawing a distinction between bitcoin spot market prices and futures market prices. The judges' apparent skepticism of the SEC's position sent GBTC higher by 5%. [\\[13\\]](#cite-id-8djabt4r838)[\\[15\\]](#cite-id-ay20jjxc9g)   \nFollowing the court proceedings, Grayscale tweeted:  \n  \n> \"We're glad to have had the opportunity to present our case.

[\\[16\\]](#cite-id-7q7mdszpk5h)[\\[17\\]](#cite-id-lc52kiewgug)  \n  \nThe suit was filed in the Court of Chancery in Delaware. It also asserts claims against Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein and Grayscale owner, [Digital Currency Group](https://iq.wiki/wiki/digital-currency-group) (DCG), and its CEO, Barry Silbert. [\\[17\\]](#cite-id-lc52kiewgug)  \n  \nAccording to Alameda’s complaint, Grayscale has extracted exorbitant management fees for its management of the Grayscale Bitcoin and Ethereum trusts and has allowed those trusts’ shares to trade at roughly a 50% discount to their net asset value. [\\[17\\]](#cite-id-lc52kiewgug)  \n  \n> \"We will continue to use every tool we can to maximize recoveries for FTX customers and creditors, our goal is to unlock value that we believe is currently being suppressed by Grayscale's self-dealing and improper redemption ban.” - said John J.
